# Creation and Configuration of the OCI Storage Bucket
In this chapter we will configure the Oracle Cloud (OCI) Object Storage Bucket that will allow you to store and retrieve the documents by our Oracle Visual Builder Web application. This actions are executed by the Web Application in sync with the creation of the HASH of the document which will be stored in Blockchain during the upload of the document to the Bucket, and the verification of the validity of the hash when the document is downloaded.

To enable the usage of the Buckets through the API REST offered by Oracle Cloud (OCI) Object Storage Buckets, we will need to create an OCI API Key related with user allowed to execute the REST API, so here below the two configuration tasks to be executed to be able to use the OCI Buckets in our VBCS Web Application:

## Creating the API Key

---
To be able to use the OCI Object Storage Buckets from your Visual Builder App you must create an OCI API Key to get access to the OCI Services via API REST 

---
  
First Sign in [OCI web console](https://cloud.oracle.com) with your credentials 

Write your tenancy name and click **Next** Button.

Select **Generate API Key Pair**. 
> Note: you could use your own public and private keys in pem format, but in this workshop and for academical purposes we'll use the auto generathed keys.

Next you must to download the *Private* and *Public* Keys to your laptop/desktop.

After that, you might have two **.pem** files one mark as public.

Then click in **Add** button.

Next window is the summary or **Configuration File Preview**. Click in the **copy** link to copy your OCI API credentials to a text file in your local computer as you will need them in future steps in the workshop. Then click **Close** Button to finish the process.

![](./images/oci-apikey-08.png)

You should have a new API key created and you should see the Fingerprint key in the OCI web console. 

![](./images/oci-apikey-09.png)

You have access to the Config file that you copied before to your desktop by clicking in the *tree vertical* dots in the Fingerprint row and select **View Config File**.

 And that's all. Congratulations. You successfully generated your API keys.

## Create a Bucket in OCI Storage
  
---
OCI Object Storage is a versatile service which is very commonly used to store application data like images, files etc. Here, we will show how to create a OCI Storage Bucket to be used to upload and download PDF documents in it from our Visual Builder app.

---

First we need to have a bucket that represents where we will be storing our objects. From the OCI Console, navigate to ***Storage â†’ Buckets***. Create a Bucket that you will be using for storage of files. For simplicity this Bucket is marked as Public, so that it doesnt require authentication, but you could achieve the same with Private visibility buckets as well.
