test the application
====================
A simple VBCS application has been created to show how to create or to interoperate with existing expedients.

This VB application interacts against the two backends used in the solution, it is BC and the buckets of OCI storage, using IC as interface to decouple the business logic
	from the navigation and presentation layers.  

Login as an expedient manager, the user will be able to access to the expedients for which he/she is the current owner, 
	... or create a new expedient, for which he/she will be the current custodian.
	being able to add more documents into the expedient, or transfer the whole expedient to a different user/department.

demo create new expedient

In any moment we can access to the Oracle Blockchain Service console to see how all the actions performed against the ledger, has been persisted in real time.

Also we can see how the uploaded documents has been saved into a bucket of our tennacy.


Login as a document reviewer, any user who has access to the app
	will be able to review documents from any expedient.
